/* Write a program in C++ to implement multiple inheritance.
Create a base class CAR, having data members:
    model  and  price  of the car and two member functions to get the values of data members and display them respectively.
Create another base class TRUCK, having data members:
    Model, color and price of the truck and
        having member functions to get the values of user of datamembers and display them.
 Create third class SALES derived from classes CAR and TRUCK.
    SALES class having No data members in it, but member function CALL to call the functions of its base classes.
 Note: Only derived class has an object. Data members must be private and member functions must be public. You can use any name for members of all three classes.
