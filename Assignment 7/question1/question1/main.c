 Write a structure to store the student number, name, age (between 16 to 21) and address of students. Store the data of 8 students. Take values of variables from user during runtime. Now perform following operations: (7%)
 a)Write a function to print the name and student number of all the students having age between 17 to 19.
 b)Write   another   function   to   print   the   names   of   all   the   students   having   odd   studentnumber.
